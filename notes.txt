 * boolean - true, false. No truthy or falsy
 * object - any js object, more specific types are possible

 string[] = array with only strings. Running a for loop over a string[] gives you access to method you can use on a regular string
 any[] = mixed types array

 * tuple - a fixed-length array. limits how the array is manipulated. Can "push" onto the array, but everything else must match the specific types.
