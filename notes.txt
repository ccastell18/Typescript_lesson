 Core Types

 * number - integers and floats
 * string - '', "", ``
 * boolean - true, false. No truthy or falsy
 * object - any js object, more specific types are possible 
 * arrays - any js array, type can be flexible or strict

 string[] = array with only strings. Running a for loop over a string[] gives you access to method you can use on a regular string
 any[] = mixed types array

 * tuple - a fixed-length array. limits how the array is manipulated. Can "push" onto the array, but everything else must match the specific types.

 * Enum - Automatically enumerated global constant identifiers


 *functions - the return is inferred. add a colon and type after the parameters



 Compiling

 *tsc {fileName.ts } --watch     will keep updating the file without having to tsc the file for every change

 *tsc --init    will watch all .ts files and compile changes

 *to exclude a file from compiling, add a key named "exclude" at the end of tsconfig.json and have an array of files you do not want compiled.

* to make sure to include files, add a key named 'include' at the end of tsconfig.json and have an array of files you want to make sure are included
